Deep Learning Survival Models for HNSCC

## Overview
Enclosed is code used for generating models that predict survival after adjuvant therapy for resected head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Aside from standard dependencies, this code will require installing a modified version of PySurvival (original work by Stephane Fotso): https://github.com/fmhoward/pysurvival

Key functions are as follows:

```
hyperparameters_RSF()
hyperparameters_DS()
hyperparameters_NMLTR()
```
